## Weather API Application

This user-friendly web application provides real-time weather information for any city you specify.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js installed on your machine.
* Express.js framework.
* Body-parser middleware.
* HTTPS module.
* An OpenWeatherMap API key (replace `5002d61070297170c81370a336f5ea068` with your own).

**Running the Application:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [invalid URL removed]
Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the Server:**

```bash
node app.js
```

4. **Access the Application:**
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

**Application Structure**
index.html: A simple HTML file that contains a form for user input (city name and temperature unit).
app.js: The main application file that sets up an Express.js server and handles user requests.
[Additional files or modules]: Any other necessary files or modules for your application's functionality.
**Usage**
Enter the desired city name and temperature unit (either Celsius or Fahrenheit).
Click the "Go!" button.
The application will display the current weather temperature and description for the specified city.
**API Integration**
The application makes an HTTPS request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. You'll need to replace the placeholder API key with your own obtained from OpenWeatherMap.
